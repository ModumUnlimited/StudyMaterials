"EProg Zusammenfassung.tex" is a WIP summary of various bits and tidbits, as updated from [DavidBohner/Zusammenfassungen/Eprog](https://github.com/DavidBohner/Zusammenfassungen/tree/master/EProg).


 Feel free to compile it yourself, but:

**Do not add a compiled PDF to this repository.**

PDFs do not go well with git tracking, as every little update to the tex would result in a new binary blob of a pdf, using up storage space in the repo history.


If you push and continuously update a PDF to this repo, when you go to sleep, I'll be under your bed.




*Edit: Yes I'm aware that there's a .png included at the moment, but until I manage to turn that shoddy sketch into a tikz-drawing, it'll have to remain a necessary evil. Plus, the contents of it should never change.*
