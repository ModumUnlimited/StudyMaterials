## DavidBohner/Zusammenfassungen/Eprog
"EProg Zusammenfassung.tex" is a WIP summary of various bits and tidbits, as updated from [DavidBohner/Zusammenfassungen/Eprog](https://github.com/DavidBohner/Zusammenfassungen/tree/master/EProg).


 Feel free to compile it yourself, but:

**Do not add a compiled PDF to this repository.**

PDFs do not go well with git tracking, as every little update to the tex would result in a new binary blob of a pdf, using up storage space in the repo history.


If you push and continuously update a PDF to this repo, when you go to sleep, I'll be under your bed.




*Edit: Yes I'm aware that there's a .png included at the moment, but until I manage to turn that shoddy sketch into a tikz-drawing, it'll have to remain a necessary evil. Plus, the contents of it should never change.*


## Java_Exception__Errors_etc_explained.pdf
It is a three page summary on exceptions and errors in Java. I know I shouldn't add PDF's to a git repo, but since it is not going to change and has a ton of dependencies I decided to add it anyway. [Look at my comment on my commit to learn more](https://github.com/ModumUnlimited/StudyMaterials/commit/104057042824aef58ba9c0990c2826cb88d2789f#commitcomment-31818995).
