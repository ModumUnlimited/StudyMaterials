Since Prof. Maurer doesn't like to see his materials on the internet you can find a link to a private repo below: (its not ideal but I dont want to get any copyright problems).

[https://github.com/davidrzs/Discrete-Mathematics-Summary](https://github.com/davidrzs/Discrete-Mathematics-Summary)

If you aren't able to access the repo, feel free to contact me so I can invite you as a collaborator, allowing you to see and copy the repo.

The repo contains:

- Solutions to weekly homework.
- A summary (6 pages long) that is still undergoing big changes. -> added a lot of examples from old exams, since Prof. Maurer likes to "recycle" old exam questions.
